      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        <h3>Cubing</h3>
        <p>I started cubing when I was like 11 years old because I got interested in how people solve cubes. I started going from 40 seconds to like an average of 15 to 17 seconds. So right now I still continue to practice and my cube collection is
          still growing.</p>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p> I learned to play chess before when I was young, but I started learning the tactics later on. I joined a chess club and continue to learn it as a hobby.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p> I first got interested in coding because I wanted to make websites. At first, I tried Java Script learning it thorugh books. When I started learning web development I knew that it was a good choice to do it. I am continuing to learn this
          skill and hopefully become a web designer one day. </p>
